The Licence Agreement

1. Preamble

This Licence applies to the computer program with which this licence is 
distributed (the "Program"). The Program is intellectual property of
   Artur Dorochowicz
(the "Author") and is placed under the protection of copyright laws.

BY USING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM),
YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENCE.

2. Rights

The Author hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with
all of the restrictions set forth in this Licence and provided, further, that
you distribute an unmodified copy of this Licence with the Program:

   1. Permission is granted to use the Program.
   2. You may copy and distribute literal (i.e. verbatim) copies of the Program
      as you receive it.
   3. You may modify the Program for your own use only. Such modified copies may
      not be distributed.
   3. You may create works based on the Program and distribute copies of such.

3. Restrictions

This licence is subject to the following restrictions:

   1. Every distribution of the Program must retain a copy of this Licence.
   2. The Program may not be sold or incorporated into any product which is sold
      without prior permission from the Author. Distribution of the Program or
      any work based on the Program to any third party without permission is
      prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such distribution,
      whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly
      (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment for
      some product or service that includes a copy of the Program "without
      charge").
   3. You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work
      that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is
      derived from the Program (the "Work"):

         1. The Work must include an acknowledgement that it in whole or in part
            contains or is derived (as applicable) from the Program.
         2. The Work must reproduce the copyright notice of the Program.
         4. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's
            exercise of the rights granted herein.

4. Reservation of Rights

No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You
may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this Licence. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this Licence will not have their licences terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance with this Licence.

5. Limitations

THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION)
HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT
LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
